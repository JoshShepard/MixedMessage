# Random Message Generator - Codecademy Portfolio Project


## Description

**Mixed Message** is a Codecademy Pro Full Stack Developer portfolio project I did to practice using **JavaScript**. In this project I 
practiced using an **object** that stores the 3 **array** data structures storing the random **hobbies**, **animes**, and **locations**. Within
that object I also practiced creating methods that can add or remove an element from those arrays. Lastly, I created a **generateMessage** method that 
gets one random word from each array and creates a random message when called. 

## Features
  + Generates random message by selecting one word from each of the arrays and displays the message to console
  + Adding and removing elements to the arrays
  + Simple program to practice using JavaScript fundamentals

### Skills worked on
  + **JavaScript**: Syntax, Objects, Arrays, and Methods
  + **VSCode**: Setup local enviroment
  + **Git and GitHub**: Version Control, pushing/pulling repositories
  + **Array manipulation**: Worked with built in methods '.push()', '.splice()' and Math.floor()/Math.random() 
  + **Objects**: Practice core concepts of objects  
  + **Problem Solving**: Implemented a solution that fulfilled the requirements within the project. Taking it one step at a time by creating object, then arrays, and finally method and logic.
